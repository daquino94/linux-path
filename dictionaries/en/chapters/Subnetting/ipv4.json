  "lessonContent": "Each network host has a unique address, and each unique address can be used to locate the host within the network. These unique addresses are known as 'IP addresses'. An IPv4 address looks something like this:\n\n<pre>204.23.124.23</pre>\n\nThis address actually contains two parts: the network portion (which identifies which network it's on), and the host portion (which identifies the host). For this course, we will mostly be discussing IPv4 addresses, which are what you commonly will see when referring to 'IP addresses'. \n\nAn IP address is separated into octets by the periods. There are 4 octets in an IPv4 address. If you know a bit of computer science, you'll know that an octet is 8 bits, and you'll know that 8 bits actually equal 1 byte. This means that an IPv4 address has 4 bytes. We use bits frequently when dealing with subnets and IP addresses.\n\nYou can view your IP address with the 'ifconfig -a' command:\n\n<pre>\npete@icebox:~$ ifconfig -a\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 1d:3a:32:24:4d:ce  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.129  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fd60::21c:29ff:fe63:5cdc/64 Scope:Link\n</pre>\n\nAs you can see my IPv4 address is: 192.168.1.129",
