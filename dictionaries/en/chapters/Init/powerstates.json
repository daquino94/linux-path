You can add a time in minutes that will shutdown the system in that amount of time.\n\n<pre>$ sudo shutdown -h +2</pre>\n\nThis will shutdown your system in two minutes. You can also restart with the shutdown command: \n\n<pre>$ sudo shutdown -r now</pre>\n\nOr just use the reboot command:\n\n<pre>$ sudo reboot</pre>",
