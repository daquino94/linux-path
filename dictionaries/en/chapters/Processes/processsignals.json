When the process is ran, the signal will be delivered. However, processes have signal masks and they can set signal delivery to be blocked if specified. When a signal is delivered, a process can do a multitude of things: \n\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore the signal</li>\n<li>\"Catch\" the signal and perform a specific handler routine</li>\n<li>Process can be terminated, as opposed to the normal exit system call</li>\n<li>Block the signal, depending on the signal mask</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Common signals</b>\n\nEach signal is defined by integers with symbolic names that are in the form of SIGxxx. Some of the most common signals are: \n\n<ul>\n<li>SIGHUP or HUP or 1: Hangup</li>\n<li>SIGINT or INT or 2: Interrupt</li>\n<li>SIGKILL or KILL or 9: Kill</li>\n<li>SIGSEGV or SEGV or 11: Segmentation fault</li>\n<li>SIGTERM or TERM or 15: Software termination</li>\n<li>SIGSTOP or STOP: Stop</li>\n</ul>\n\nNumbers can vary with signals so they are usually referred by their names.\n\nSome signals are unblockable, one example is the SIGKILL signal. The KILL signal destroys the process.",
