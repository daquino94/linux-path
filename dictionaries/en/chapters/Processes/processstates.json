The most common state codes you'll see are described below:\n\n<ul>\n<li>R: running or runnable, it is just waiting for the CPU to process it</li>\n<li>S: Interruptible sleep, waiting for an event to complete, such as input from the terminal</li>\n<li>D: Uninterruptible sleep, processes that cannot be killed or interrupted with a signal, usually to make them go away you have to reboot or fix the issue</li>\n<li>Z: Zombie, we discussed in a previous lesson that zombies are terminated processes that are waiting to have their statuses collected</li>\n<li>T: Stopped, a process that has been suspended/stopped</li>\n</ul>",
