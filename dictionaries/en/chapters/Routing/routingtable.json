If I was 192.168.224.5 and wanted to get to 192.168.224.7, I would just use the network interface eth0 directly. \n\nNotice that we have addresses of <b>0.0.0.0</b> this means that no address is specified or it's unknown. So if for example, I wanted to send a packet to IP address 151.123.43.6, our routing table doesn't know where that goes, so it denotes it as 0.0.0.0 and therefore routes our packet to the Gateway.\n\n<b>Gateway</b>\n\nIf we are sending a packet that is not on the same network, it will be sent to this Gateway address. Which is aptly named as being a Gateway to another network.\n\n<b>Genmask</b>\n\nThis is the subnet mask, used to figure out what IP addresses match what destination. \n\n<b>Flags</b>\n\n<ul>\n<li>UG - Network is Up and is a Gateway</li>\n<li>U - Network is Up</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Iface</b>\n\nThis is the interface that our packet will be going out of, eth0 usually stands for the first Ethernet device on your system.",
