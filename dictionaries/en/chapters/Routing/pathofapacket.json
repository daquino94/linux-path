And we can't use ARP because the ARP request is a broadcast to locally connected hosts.</li>\n<li>So our packet now looks at the routing table, it doesn't know the address of the destination IP, so it sends it out to the default gateway (another router). So now our packet contains our source IP, destination IP and source MAC, however we don't have a destination MAC. Remember MAC addresses are only reached through the same network. So what does it do? It sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the default gateway.</li>\n<li>The router looks at the packet and confirms the destination MAC address, but it's not the final destination IP address, so it keeps looking at the routing table to forward the packet to another IP address that can help the packet move along to its destination. Everytime the packet moves, it strips the old source and destination MAC address and updates the packet with the new source and destination MAC addresses.</li>\n<li>Once the packet gets forwarded to the same network, we use ARP to find the final destination MAC address</li>\n<li>During this process, our packet doesn't change the source or destination IP address.</li>\n</ol>",
