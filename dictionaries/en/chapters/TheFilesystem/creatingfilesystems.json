The <b>mkfs</b> (make filesystem) tool allows us to specify the type of filesystem we want and where we want it. You'll only want to create a filesystem on a newly partitioned disk or if you are repartitioning an old one. You'll most likely leave your filesystem in a corrupted state if you try to create one on top of an existing one.",
