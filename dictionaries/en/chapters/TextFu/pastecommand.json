Let's create a new file with the following contents: \n\n<pre>\nsample2.txt\nThe\nquick\nbrown\nfox\n</pre>\n\nLet's combine all these lines into one line: \n\n<pre>$ paste -s sample2.txt</pre>\n\nThe default delimiter for paste is TAB, so now there is one line with TABs separating each word.\n\nLet's change this delimiter (-d) to something a little more readable: \n\n<pre>$ paste -d ' ' -s sample2.txt</pre>\n\nNow everything should be on one line delimited by spaces.",
