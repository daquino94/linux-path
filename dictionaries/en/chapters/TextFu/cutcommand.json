  "lessonContent": "We're gonna learn a couple of useful commands that you can use to process text. Before we get started, let's create a file that we'll be working with. Copy and paste the following command, once you do that add a TAB in between lazy and dog (hold down Ctrl-v + TAB).\n\n<pre>$ echo 'The quick brown; fox jumps over the lazy  dog' > sample.txt</pre>\n\nFirst command we'll be learning about is the cut command. It extracts portions of text from a file. \n\nTo extract contents by a list of characters: \n\n<pre>$ cut -c 5 sample.txt</pre>\n\nThis outputs the 5th character in each line of the file. In this case it is \"q\", note that the space also counts as a character. \n\nTo extract the contents by a field, we'll need to do a little modification: \n\n<pre>$ cut -f 2 sample.txt</pre>\n\nThe -f or field flag cuts text based off of fields, by default it uses TABs as delimiters, so everything separated by a TAB is considered a field. You should see \"dog\" as your output.\n\nYou can combine the field flag with the delimiter flag to extract the contents by a custom delimiter: \n\n<pre>$ cut -f 1 -d \";\" sample.txt</pre>\n\nThis will change the TAB delimiter to a \";\" delimiter and since we are cutting the first field, the result should be \"The quick brown\".",
