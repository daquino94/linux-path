  "lessonContent": "Similar to the head command, the tail command lets you see the last 10 lines of a file by default.\n\n<pre>$ tail /var/log/syslog</pre>\n\nAlong with head you can change the number of lines you want to see.\n\n<pre>$ tail -n 10 /var/log/syslog</pre>\n\nAnother great option you can use is the -f (follow) flag, this will follow the file as it grows. Give it a try and see what happens. \n\n<pre>$ tail -f /var/log/syslog</pre> \n\nYour syslog file will be continually changing while you interact with your system and using tail -f you can see everything that is getting added to that file.",
  "exercise": "Look at the man page of tail and read some of the other commands we didn't discuss. \n\n<pre>$ man tail</pre>",
