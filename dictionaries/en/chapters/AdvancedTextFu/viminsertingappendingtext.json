This can get pretty confusing especially if you just want to open a file and enter text. The command mode is used for when you enter commands like h,j,k.l etc. To insert text you'll need to enter insert mode first. </p><p></p><ul><br><li>i - insert text before the cursor</li><br><li>O - insert text on the previous line</li><br><li>o - insert text on the next line</li><br><li>a - append text after the cursor</li><br><li>A - append text at the end of the line</li><br></ul><p></p><p>Notice how when you type any of these insertion modes, you'll see that vim has entered insert mode at the bottom of the shell.
