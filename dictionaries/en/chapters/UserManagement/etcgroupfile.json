This file allows for different groups with different permissions. \n\n<pre>$ cat /etc/group\n\nroot:*:0:pete\n</pre>\n\nVery similar to the /etc/password field, the /etc/group fields are as follows:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Group name</li>\n<li>Group password - there isn't a need to set a group password, using an elevated privilege like sudo is standard. A \"*\" will be put in place as the default value.</li>\n<li>Group ID (GID)</li>\n<li>List of users - you can manually specify users you want in a specific group</li>\n</ol>",
