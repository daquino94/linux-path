  "lessonContent": "<b>Overview</b>\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source code for free.\n\n<b>Package Management</b>\nRHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM package manager, which we will eventually learn about as well.\n\n<b>Configurability</b>\nRHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the Debian-based operating systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go with RHEL it’s probably best if you know you’ll be working with it.\n\n<b>Uses</b>\nAs described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server OS this would be a good one.",
