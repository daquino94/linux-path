  "lessonContent": "<b>Overview</b>\nGentoo offers ridiculous flexibility with the operating system at a price. It’s made for advanced users who don’t mind getting their hands dirty with the system.\n\n<b>Package Management</b>\nGentoo uses its own package management, Portage. The Portage package management is very modular and easy to maintain, which plays a big part in the operating system as a whole being very flexible.\n\n<b>Configurability</b>\nIf you’re just getting started with Linux and want to take a more difficult path, I’d choose Gentoo or Arch Linux as your distribution.\n\n<b>Uses</b>\nGreat for desktop and laptop.",
