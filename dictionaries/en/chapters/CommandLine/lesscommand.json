  "lessonContent": "If you are viewing text files larger than a simple output, less is more. (There is actually a command called more that does something similar, so this is ironic.) The text is displayed in a paged manner, so you can navigate through a text file page by page. \n\nGo ahead and look at the contents of a file with less. Once you’re in the less command, you can actually use other keyboard commands to navigate in the file. \n\n<pre>$ less /home/pete/Documents/text1</pre>\n\nUse the following command to navigate through less: \n\n<ul>\n<li>q - Used to quit out of less and go back to your shell.</li>\n<li>Page up, Page down, Up and Down - Navigate using the arrow keys and page keys.</li>\n<li>g - Moves to beginning of the text file.</li>\n<li>G - Moves to the end of the text file.</li>\n<li>/search - You can search for specific text inside the text document. Prefacing the words you want to search with /</li>\n<li>h - If you need a little help about how to use less while you’re in less, use help.</li>\n</ul>",
