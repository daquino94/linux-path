  "lessonContent": "Used for moving files and also renaming them. Quite similar to the cp command in terms of flags and functionality. \n\nYou can rename files like this:\n\n<pre>$ mv oldfile newfile</pre>\n\nOr you can actually move a file to a different directory: \n\n<pre>$ mv file2 /home/pete/Documents</pre>\n\nAnd move more than one file:\n\n<pre>$ mv file_1 file_2 /somedirectory</pre>\n\nYou can rename directories as well:\n\n<pre>$ mv directory1 directory2</pre>\n\nLike cp, if you mv a file or directory it will overwrite anything in the same directory. So you can use the -i flag to prompt you before overwriting anything.\n\n<pre>mv -i directory1 directory2</pre>\n\nLetâ€™s say you did want to mv a file to overwrite the previous one. You can also make a backup of that file and it will just rename the old version with a ~. \n\n<pre>$ mv -b directory1 directory2</pre>",
