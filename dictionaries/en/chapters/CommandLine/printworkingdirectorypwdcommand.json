  "lessonContent": "Everything in Linux is a file. As you journey deeper into Linux you’ll understand this, but for now just keep it in mind. Every file is organized within a hierarchical directory tree. The first directory in the filesystem is aptly named the 'root directory'. The root directory has many folders and files, in which you can store more folders and files, and so on and so on. Here is an example of what the directory tree looks like: \n\n<pre>/\n|-- bin\n|   |-- file1\n|   |-- file2\n|-- etc\n|   |-- file3\n|   `-- directory1\n|       |-- file4\n|       `-- file5\n|-- home\n|-- var\n</pre>\n\nThe locations of these files and directories are referred to as 'paths'. If you had a folder named 'home' that had a folder inside it named 'pete' and another folder in that folder named 'Movies', that path would look like this: '/home/pete/Movies'. Pretty simple huh?\n\nNavigating the filesystem, much like navigating in real life, is easier if you know where you are and where you are going. To see where you are, you can use the 'pwd' command. This command means “print working directory” and it shows you which directory you are in. Note that the path stems from the root directory.\n\n<pre>$ pwd</pre>\n\nWhere are you? Where am I?
