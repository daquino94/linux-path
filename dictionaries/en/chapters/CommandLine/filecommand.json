Did you notice that the filename didn’t conform to standard naming like you’ve probably seen with other operating systems like Windows? Normally you would expect a file called banana.jpeg and expect a JPEG picture file. \n\nIn Linux, filenames aren’t required to represent the contents of the file. You can create a file called funny.gif that isn’t actually a GIF. \n\nTo find out what kind of file a file is, you can use the file command. It will show you a description of the file’s contents.\n\n<pre>$ file banana.jpg</pre>",
