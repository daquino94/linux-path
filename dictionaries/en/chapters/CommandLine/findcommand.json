Well there’s a command we can use for that, find! \n\n<pre>$ find /home -name puppies.jpg</pre>\n\nWith find you’ll have to specify the directory you’ll be searching it, what you’re searching for, in this case we are trying to find a file by the name of puppies.jpg. \n\nYou can specify what type of file you are trying to find. \n\n<pre>$ find /home -type d -name MyFolder</pre>\n\nYou can see that I set the type of file I’m trying to find as (d) for directory and I’m still searching by the name of MyFolder. \n\nOne cool thing to note is that find doesn’t stop at the directory you are searching, it will look inside any subdirectories that directory may have as well.",
