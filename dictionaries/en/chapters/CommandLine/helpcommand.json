One tool, help, is a built-in bash command that provides help for other bash commands (echo, logout, pwd, etc).\n\n<pre>$ help echo</pre>\n\nThis will give you a description and the options you can use when you want to run echo. For other executable programs, it’s convention to have an option called --help or something similar. \n\n<pre>$ echo --help</pre>\n\nNot all developers who ship out executables will conform to this standard, but it’s probably your best shot to find some help on a program.",
