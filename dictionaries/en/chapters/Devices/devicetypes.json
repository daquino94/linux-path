Device files are denoted as the following: \n\n<ul>\n<li>c - character</li>\n<li>b - block</li>\n<li>p - pipe</li>\n<li>s - socket</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Character Device</b>\n\nThese devices transfer data, but one a character at a time. You'll see a lot of pseudo devices (/dev/null) as character devices, these devices aren't really physically connected to the machine, but they allow the operating system greater functionality. \n\n<b>Block Device</b>\n\nThese devices transfer data, but in large fixed-sized blocks. You'll most commonly see devices that utilize data blocks as block devices, such as harddrives, filesystems, etc. \n\n<b>Pipe Device</b>\n\nNamed pipes allow two or more processes to communicate with each other, these are similar to character devices, but instead of having output sent to a device, it's sent to another process. \n\n<b>Socket Device</b>\n\nSocket devices facilitate communication between processes, similar to pipe devices but they can communicate with many processes at once. \n\n<b>Device Characterization</b>\n\nDevices are characterized using two numbers, <b>major device number</b> and <b>minor device number</b>. You can see these numbers in the above ls example, they are separated by a comma. For example, let's say a device had the device numbers: <b>8, 0</b>:\n\nThe major device number represents the device driver that is used, in this case 8, which is often the major number for sd block devices. The minor number tells the kernel which unique device it is in this driver class, in this case 0 is used to represent the first device (a).",
