This bit allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group. \n\nLet's look at one example: \n\n<pre>$ ls -l /usr/bin/wall\n-rwxr-sr-x 1 root tty 19024 Dec 14 11:45 /usr/bin/wall\n</pre>\n\nWe can see now that the permission bit is in the group permission set. \n\n<b>Modifying SGID</b>\n\n<pre>$ sudo chmod g+s myfile\n$ sudo chmod 2555 myfile\n</pre>\n\nThe numerical representation for SGID is 2.",
