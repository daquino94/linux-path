  "lessonContent": "One last special permission bit I want to talk about is the sticky bit. \n\nThis permission bit, \"sticks a file/directory\" this means that only the owner or the root user can delete or modify the file. This is very useful for shared directories. Take a look at the example below:\n\n<pre>$ ls -ld /tmp\ndrwxrwxrwxt 6 root root 4096 Dec 15 11:45 /tmp\n</pre>\n\nYou'll see a special permission bit at the end here <b>t</b>, this means everyone can add files, write files, modify files in the /tmp directory, but only root can delete the /tmp directory. \n\n<b>Modify sticky bit</b>\n\n<pre>$ sudo chmod +t mydir\n\n$ sudo chmod 1755 mydir</pre>\n\nThe numerical representation for the sticky bit is <b>1</b>",
